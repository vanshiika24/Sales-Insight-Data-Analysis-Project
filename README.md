Sales Insight Data Analysis Project:

- Building a Power BI dashboard for visualizing the insights of the sales of a company by analyzing and managing very large data.
- Tech Involved: MySQL, Power BI, DAX language etc.

I built a Power BI dashboard and analyzed & visualized the sales data on the basis of the year, market, customers and many other factors which affect sales of a company. With this Insights model a company's sales manager would easily be able to look at the company's growth, revenue, profit margins etc. and will be able to apply appropriate strategies to render the weaknesses of the company.
